# Insights on Financial Complaints
Analyze financial complaints to generate insights about them

## Context
Imagine a company that works with customer complaints and
offers its services to companies in the financial sector.
This company is looking for new customers. Due to labor and budget constraints,
it can not approach all companies at the same time and need to shortlist its
prospective customers

### Assumptions
* Neither constraints nor service prices are known.
* We are interested in short term tendencies, therefore data was filtered (>= 2018) or open complaints.

## Goal
Offers insights where the company can shortlist their 
prospective customers driven by data.

### Questions and Hypothesis
Is the company with the most complaints the one with most 'In progress' status?
How are types of complaints distributed? Are companies 'specialized' in certain complaints?
Are there trends in types of complaints?
Are there companies with upward trend in complaints? What type?
How could companies be shortlisted?
